The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an
architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java List Interface
List Interface is the subinterface of Collection.
It contains index-based methods to insert and delete elements.
It is a factory of ListIterator interface.


ListIterator Interface is used to traverse the element in a
 backward and forward direction.

Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements.
It inherits AbstractList class and implements List interface.


Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the
elements. It provides a linked-list data structure.

Java HashSet class is used to create a collection
that uses a hash table for storage. It inherits the
 AbstractSet class and implements Set interface.

A map contains values on the basis of key, i.e. key
and value pair. Each key and value pair is known
as an entry. A Map contains unique keys.
