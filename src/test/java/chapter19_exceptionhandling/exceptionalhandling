The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism
to handle the runtime errors so that normal
 flow of the application can be maintained.

In Java, an exception is an event that disrupts the
 normal flow of the program. It is an object which
 is thrown at runtime.

1) Checked: are the exceptions that are checked at compile time.
If some code within a method throws a checked exception,
then the method must either handle the exception or
it must specify the exception using throws keyword.

2)Unchecked are the exceptions that are not checked at compiled time.
In C++, all exceptions are unchecked, so it is not forced
by the compiler to either handle or specify the exception.
It is up to the programmers to be civilized, and specify
 or catch the exceptions.

eg:ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc


3)Error
  Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError,
  VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.
