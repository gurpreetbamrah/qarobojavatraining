Following are some ways in which you can create objects in Java:

1) Using new Keyword : Using new keyword is the most basic way to create an object.
 This is the most common way to create an object in java.
  Almost 99% of objects are created in this way.


2) Using New Instance : If we know the name of the class &
if it has a public default constructor we can create an object –Class.forName.
We can use it to create the Object of a Class.
Class.forName actually loads the
Class in Java but doesn’t create any Object.
To Create an Object of the Class you
 have to use the new Instance Method of the Class.


3) Using clone() method: Whenever clone() is called on any object,
 the JVM actually creates a new object and copies all content of
 the previous object into it. Creating an object using the clone
  method does not invoke any constructor.
 To use clone() method on an object we need to implement
 Cloneable and define the clone() method in it.
